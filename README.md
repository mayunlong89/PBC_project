# Title of this project:
Integrated GWAS and scRNA-seq analysis identifies genetics-influenced novel genes and cholangiocytes associated with primary biliary cholangitis susceptibility

# Abstract
  Importance: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a classical autoimmune disease, which is highly influenced by genetic factors. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported a group of genetic loci associated with PBC susceptibility. However, the functional effects of genetic loci on liver cell subpopulations for PBC remain largely unknown.

  Objective: To highlight novel risk genes and examine whether these genetic risk genes affect liver cell types for PBC based on integrative genomics analysis.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this integrative genomics analysis, 13,239 European participants were collected from IEU open GWAS project on PBC. There were 1,124,241 qualified SNPs used for GWAS analysis. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data across 49 tissues were downloaded from the GTEx database. Two bulk-based and two single cell RNA expression profiles were downloaded from the GEO database. Data collection and analysis were performed from August 2020 to June 2021. 
Main outcomes and measures: Summary statistics from the GWAS study were leveraged to extract genetic association signals. We conducted systematic bioinformatics analyses, such as gene-level genetic association analysis, S-MultiXcan integrative genomics analysis, gene-property analysis, drug-gene interaction, gene-gene interaction analysis, and Rolypoly-based scRNA-seq analysis. 

  Results: Based on comprehensive genomics analysis, we found 29 risk genes were significantly associated with PBC. There were 19 genes, including GSNK2B (P = 7.17×10-19), LY6G5B (P = 2.43×10-16), DDAH2 (P = 1.39×10-15), and C6orf48 (P = 9.57×10-9), identified to be novel risk genes for PBC. Based on disease-based enrichment analysis, these genes were significantly overrepresented in autoimmune disease (P = 8.47×10-8), type I diabetes mellitus (P = 2.04×10-4), and immune system diseases (P = 1.41×10-3). Differential gene expression analysis based on three independent RNA data uncovered 22 of 29 genes (75.86%) were significantly expressed among PBC patients compared with controls. Drug-gene interaction analysis revealed 20 of 29 genes (68.96%) showed enrichments in ten potential druggable gene categories. Based on integrative genomics analysis of GWAS with scRNA-seq data, we found that genetics-influenced changiocytes were significantly associated with PBC, and risk genes of ORMDL3, CTSH, TSFM, and ZCRB1 showed highly specific expression in changiocytes. 

  Conclusions and relevance: In this study, we prioritized 29 genes including 19 novel genes were significantly associated with PBC susceptibility, and found genetics-influenced changiocytes had important roles in the etiology of PBC.

# Introduction

  Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), which is formally known as primary biliary cirrhosis until 2016 1, is a rare chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive autoimmune-mediated destruction of the small intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells 2,3. PBC patients suffering from chronic cholestasis can eventually lead to cirrhosis and hepatic failure without effective treatments 2,4,5. Although ursodeoxycholic acid has been used as the first-line therapeutic agent for PBC, there exist 10% to 20% of PBC patients resistant to ursodeoxycholic acid and develop to advanced-stage liver disease 2,6. The aetiology of PBC has been extensively reported to be influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors 7-9. Therefore, there is a great interest in uncovering the genetic architecture that involved in the pathology of PBC, which may promote the development of effective therapeutics for PBC. 

  With the advance of single cell sequencing techniques including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq), and mass cytometry, researchers enable to discover more refined and novel cell types for complex diseases 22. An accruing and large number of studies on autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis 23, inflammatory bowel disease 24, systemic lupus erythematosus 25, and Crohn’s disease 26, have been reported to parse heterogeneity of cellular subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. In view of there was no single-cell RNA-seq study performed for uncovering liver cell types associated with PBC, we here performed a comprehensive genomics analysis by integrating multi-omics data, including GWAS summary data, eQTL data, bulk gene expression data, and scRNAS-seq data, to identify novel PBC-associated risk genes and genetically pinpoint liver cell subpopulations implicated in the pathogenesis of PBC.

# Methods
## GWAS summary statistics on primary biliary cholangitis
   In the current investigation, we employed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data on PBC 10 for uncovering novel PBC-associated risk genes and variants. For this GWAS dataset, which is downloaded from the IEU open GWAS project (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/), there were 2,764 PBC patients and 10,475 healthy controls used for performing meta-analysis of genome-wide association signals based on European ancestry. Human subjects enrolled in this GWAS were approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board, the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, Etico Indipendente IRCCS Istituto Clinico Humanitas, UC Davis Institutional Review Board and the Oxford Research Ethics Committee 10. A standard quality control (QC) pipeline was applied to remove low-quality SNPs from further analysis. The software package of MaCH 27 with the reference of HapMap3 CEU + TSI samples was implemented to perform a genome-wide imputation analysis. There were 1,124,241 SNPs with minor allele frequency > 0.005 and imputation quality score R2 > 0.5 in GWAS samples included in follow-up analyses. 

## Bulk-based expression profiles of primary biliary cholangitis-related risk genes
  To validate the functionality of these identified PBC-associated risk genes, we downloaded two bulk-based expression datasets based on liver tissue (accession number: GSE159676) and blood (accession number: GSE119600) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. For the liver dataset of GSE159676, there were six healthy controls and three PBC cases based on fresh frozen tissue obtained from explanted livers or diagnostic liver biopsies. The Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 st array was leveraged to obtain bulk expression profiles of 17,046 probes. With respect to the blood dataset of GSE119600 44, bulk-based expression profiles were performed using RNA isolated from whole blood samples from 47 healthy controls and 90 PBC patients. The Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip was leveraged to obtain blood transcriptome of 47,230 probes. Differential gene expression (DGE) analyses between controls and patients of both datasets were examined by using Student’s T-test, and P value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be of significance. 

## Single-cell expression profiles of primary biliary cholangitis-related risk genes

  To explore the functions of PBC-related risk genes in single cells of liver tissue, we downloaded two independent single cell RNA profiles (accession number: GSE93170 and GSE115469) from the GEO database. With regard to the dataset of GSE93170 45, there were clinically and pathologically diagnosed six healthy controls and six PBC patients enrolled with written informed consent. Peripheral CD4+T cells were used to extract total RNA. The Agilent microarray of SurePrint G3 human GE 8×60K microarray kit was leveraged to produce gene expression profiles according to manufacturer’s protocols. The Student’s T-test was used for assessing the difference between PBC and control group. Furthermore, we also carried out a co-expression pattern analysis of these identified risk genes among PBC group and control group to evaluate whether the co-expression link changed due to the disease status. 
  
  As for the GSE115469 dataset 46, five samples from primary liver patients were used for single cell RNA sequencing based on the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kits. A total of 8,444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells have obtained the transcriptional profiles based on the CellRanger analysis pipeline. The raw digital matrix of gene expression (namely UMI counts per gene per cell) was filtered, normalized and clustered. Cell was omitted if it has a very high (>0.5) mitochondrial genome transcript ratio or a very small library size (<1500). Based on these single-cell profiles using the standard Seurat package 47, there were 20 discrete clustered. We used well-known marker genes assigned these clusters into 13 distinct cell subpopulations, including portal endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, non-inflammatory macrophages, T cells, γδT cells, inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK)-like cells, red blood cells (RBCs), sinusoidal endothelial cells, mature B cells, stellate cells, plasma cells, and hepatocytes.
